# Changelog

All notable changes to `@somewhere-tech/sdk`.

This project is pre-1.0. Following the repo convention (0.3.0 → 0.4.0 was the
last feature/breaking bump), the **minor** version is the breaking lever until
1.0.0. So a default-semantics change bumps the minor.

## 0.12.0 (2026-10-06) — browser-bound social sign-in (platform tsk_ec24c4ba)

### Changed
- `somewhereAuth` starts Google, GitHub and Discord sign-in with the runtime's
  `sw.auth.oauthStart(provider, { redirect_uri })`, which binds the attempt to
  the browser that starts it (an HttpOnly verifier cookie on this response;
  only its challenge travels in the URL). `GET /api/auth/<provider>-url` still
  answers `{ url }`. Exchange route paths stay the same; their request bodies
  now include the callback’s public `attempt` identifier.
- A runtime without `oauthStart` answers `501 OAUTH_START_UNAVAILABLE` (redeploy
  to pick up the current runtime) instead of starting an unbound sign-in. The
  old `googleUrl` / `githubUrl` / `discordUrl` builders are never called.
- The sign-in callback carries a public `?attempt=` beside `?code=`.
  `completeGoogleSignIn` / `completeGithubSignIn` / `completeDiscordSignIn`
  send it (read from the callback page URL when not passed) and the handler
  forwards it to the runtime exchange. It only selects which of this
  browser's attempt cookies the server presents; the platform proves the full
  challenge before the code counts.

## 0.11.6 (2026-10-04) — email verification for cookie sessions

### Added
- `somewhereAuth` serves email verification for the request's own session,
  with no token in app or browser code:
  - `GET /verify-email` returns `{ email_verified }` (401 `AUTH_REQUIRED` when
    signed out);
  - `POST /request-email-verification` emails a 6-digit code to the account's
    address;
  - `POST /verify-email` with `{ code }` checks it.
- Client methods on `createSomewhereAuth()`: `auth.emailVerified()`,
  `auth.requestEmailVerification()` and `auth.verifyEmail({ code })`. They use
  the session through the packaged handler.
- A refusal keeps the platform's code and 4xx status (for example
  `AUTH_INVALID_CODE` 400); any other failure answers 502, never success. A
  runtime without the cookie verification helpers answers
  `501 EMAIL_VERIFICATION_UNAVAILABLE` before calling anything.

### Upgrading
- Update the SDK dependency and lockfile to 0.11.6, then redeploy as usual.
  Apps already deployed keep the SDK they were bundled with.

## 0.11.5 (2026-10-02) — sign-out answers ok only when it is confirmed

### Fixed
- Header sessions are now actually revoked on sign-out. `signOut()` sends the
  session's refresh token as `X-Refresh-Token`, and `somewhereAuth`'s
  `POST /logout` revokes that refresh session. It answers 2xx only when the
  platform confirms the revocation; any refusal, including
  `SESSION_NOT_FOUND`, stays non-2xx, so the client keeps the sign-out marked
  unconfirmed. A bearer with no refresh token, which is what 0.11.4 and earlier
  clients sent, is refused with `400 LOGOUT_REFRESH_REQUIRED` instead of
  answering ok for a session that stayed live.
- Cookie sign-out no longer hides errors. An error thrown by the runtime's
  `sw.auth.logoutWithCookie` becomes a non-2xx response that keeps its code
  (and its status when it is a 4xx, otherwise 502), with the message "Could
  not confirm sign-out.". An answer other than `{ ok: true }` is
  `502 SIGN_OUT_UNCONFIRMED`. A runtime without the helper gets
  `501 COOKIE_SESSION_UNAVAILABLE`; the handler no longer calls `logout({})`
  and reports success.

### Upgrading
- Apps already deployed keep the SDK they were bundled with. Update the SDK
  dependency and lockfile to 0.11.5, then redeploy as usual.
- This release does not fix cookie sign-out on its own. The platform runtime's
  current `logoutWithCookie` still swallows upstream revocation errors and
  answers ok, so cookie sign-out behaves as before until that runtime update is
  deployed.

### Tests
- `test/unit-header-logout.mjs` and `test/unit-cookie-logout.mjs` cover
  confirmed, refused, unconfirmed and malformed outcomes in both modes.

## 0.11.4 (2026-10-02) — server auth adapter accepts the platform runtime context

### Fixed
- `@somewhere-tech/sdk/server`: the `SwAuthNamespace` type now accepts the
  platform's generated `sw` runtime context, so `somewhereAuth` type-checks as
  a deployed function's `(req, sw)` handler. The Google, GitHub and Discord
  URL helpers may return the URL synchronously as a string (older
  asynchronous adapters that resolve a string or `{ url }` still fit), and
  `checkoutForUser`/`portalForUser` results may carry `url: null`. Handler
  behaviour and argument types are unchanged.

### Tests
- A type-level test checks `somewhereAuth` against a frozen copy of the
  platform's runtime context declarations, with negative controls.

## 0.11.3 (2026-10-01) — project SEO metadata and optional analytics consent

### Added
- `projects.seoCheck(projectId?)` reads SEO metadata from the active release's
  deployed homepage artifacts. It returns release provenance and coverage;
  live rendering, other client routes and search indexing remain unverified.
- `projects.update({ analytics_consent: { mode, policy_version } }, projectId?)`
  updates the optional project analytics consent policy. The platform validates
  the policy and project editor access. Both methods use developer credentials
  and accept the configured project or an explicit project ID.
- Exported SEO metadata and analytics consent policy/update result types.

### Tests
- The normal test suite now runs the existing analytics consent update fixture
  alongside the existing project metadata and authorization checks.

## 0.11.1 (2026-09-27) — a sign-out is pending until the server answers

### Added
- `AuthState.signingOut` (and `useAuthState().signingOut`): true from a
  `signOut()` call until its `/logout` is answered, fails, or times out.
  `user` is still cleared at once, but until the server answers it may still
  accept the session. Show a pending state while this is true; show signed out
  only when it is false and `signOutUnconfirmed` is false.
- `<SignedOut pending={…}>` and `<Protect pending={…}>`: while a sign-out
  awaits the server they render `pending` (default nothing) instead of their
  signed-out children / `fallback`.

### Changed
- `<SignedOut>` no longer renders its children, and `<Protect>` no longer
  renders its `fallback`, between a `signOut()` call and the server's answer.
  Before, a sign-in form inside `<SignedOut>` appeared while the server could
  still accept the session. `<SignedIn>` is unchanged (it hides at once).
- The `'signed-out'` status documentation now says what it always meant: no
  identity in this client, either confirmed by the backend or cleared by
  `signOut()`. `signingOut` and `signOutUnconfirmed` say whether the server has
  confirmed it. Existing behaviour is unchanged.

## 0.11.0 (2026-09-27) — session status, and sign-in/sign-out that cannot land out of order

Default-semantics changes (per the convention above this is a minor bump;
the version is set at release).

### Added
- `auth.getState()` and the `onChange` argument report `status`:
  `'checking'` (no answer yet; a cached user is unverified), `'authenticated'`,
  `'signed-out'`, or `'indeterminate'` (the check failed on a network error, a
  non-401 error status or an unreadable body; `user` is the last-known
  identity, unverified), plus `error` (`SESSION_CHECK_FAILED`,
  `SIGN_OUT_UNCONFIRMED`) and `signOutUnconfirmed`. `useAuthState()` in
  `@somewhere-tech/sdk/react` returns the same plus `recheck()`.
- `createSomewhereAuth({ mutationTimeoutMs })` bounds one queued sign-in or
  sign-out call, including reading the response and any follow-up `/me`
  (default 30000 ms; `AUTH_TIMEOUT`). Values outside 1–2147483647 ms throw
  `RangeError`.

### Changed
- A `/me` answer, a 401, or a header-mode token rotation that started before a
  newer sign-in or `signOut()` no longer changes the user, session or status.
  Before, a late answer could bring back a signed-out user, wipe or replace a
  new sign-in, or clear it.
- Sign-in, sign-up, magic-link verify, OAuth completions and `/logout` from one
  client run in call order. A sign-in answered after a newer `signOut()` or
  sign-in rejects with `AuthError` code `AUTH_SUPERSEDED` and changes nothing;
  the queued logout still runs after it. `getUser()` waits for queued calls and
  shares one `/me` per identity change.
- A `/me` 200 without a readable `user` now leaves the last-known user with
  status `'indeterminate'` instead of signing out. `{ user: null }` and 401 still
  sign out.
- `signOut()` still clears local state immediately and resolves. Clearing
  local state is not reported as a server sign-out: when `/logout` fails, times
  out or is refused, `signOutUnconfirmed` is true and `error.code` is
  `'SIGN_OUT_UNCONFIRMED'` until a later `signOut()` reaches the server (it
  retries, with the header session it was for), `/me` answers definitively,
  or a sign-in replaces the session. In cookie mode it also calls `/logout`
  when a sign-in is still queued.
- A sign-in that fails (refused, network, timeout) after it invalidated the
  first check re-checks `/me`, so the status does not stay `'checking'`. A
  failure that lands after a newer sign-in or sign-out changes nothing.
- Another tab signing in as someone else sets `'checking'` and re-checks `/me`
  instead of adopting that tab's cached user. Same-identity updates from other
  tabs are ignored, and an unchanged cached user is not rewritten.

Ordering covers one client instance. Other tabs, or a request the server
processes late, can still change the shared cookies; the next check reports it.

## 0.10.0 (2026-09-26) — The packaged sign-in handler never returns tokens unless asked

**Breaking (callers of `somewhereAuth` that read tokens from the response
without sending a mode header).**

### Changed
- **`somewhereAuth` answers a sign-in with the cookie session only, unless the
  caller explicitly asks for tokens.** Before, a request with no
  `X-Sw-Auth-Mode` header — for example a plain
  `fetch('/api/auth/login', { credentials: 'include' })` from a page — got the
  session cookie AND the access and refresh tokens in the response body, where
  any script on the page could read them. Now signup, login, magic-link verify
  and the Google/GitHub/Discord exchanges answer
  `{ user, cookie_session: true }` and set the httpOnly cookie. Only
  `X-Sw-Auth-Mode: header` (or `token`) returns the token pair, and then no
  cookie is set — that is for a server or native client that holds its own
  session.
- `createSomewhereAuth({ mode: 'header' })` now sends `X-Sw-Auth-Mode: header`
  on sign-in, so header-mode clients keep receiving tokens from the packaged
  handler. A header-mode client older than 0.10.0 sends no header and now gets
  the cookie answer instead: upgrade it together with the handler.
- A deploy whose runtime cannot set the session cookie answers
  `501 COOKIE_SESSION_UNAVAILABLE` instead of returning tokens. Redeploying
  picks up the current runtime.

## 0.9.0 (2026-09-26) — Cookie sign-in fails loudly; Subscribe and Manage billing work

**Breaking (browser sign-in against a handler without cookie mode).**

### Changed
- **A browser sign-in that the server doesn't confirm as a cookie session now
  throws instead of storing tokens.** `createSomewhereAuth()` in a browser (or
  with `mode: 'cookie'`) asks your `/api/auth` handler for a cookie session.
  When the handler does not reply `cookie_session: true`, `signIn`, `signUp`,
  `verifyMagicLink` and the OAuth completions now throw an `AuthError` with
  `code: 'COOKIE_SESSION_NOT_CONFIRMED'` and store nothing. The message names
  the fix: mount `somewhereAuth` from `@somewhere-tech/sdk/server`, or make
  your handler set the session cookies and reply
  `{ user, cookie_session: true }`. Before, the client quietly kept the
  returned token pair in `localStorage`, where page scripts can read it.
- `AuthError` has an optional `code`, set when the client itself refuses a
  response.

### Fixed
- **The `<PricingTable>` Subscribe button starts a checkout.** The packaged
  handler's `/billing/checkout` route called
  `sw.payments.checkoutForUser(userId, opts)`, but the runtime takes one
  `opts` argument and derives the buyer from the signed-in user, so every
  Subscribe click failed with `sw.payments.checkoutForUser: opts.plan is
  required`.
- **`<BillingPortal>` (Manage billing) opens the portal.** The same mismatch
  in `/billing/portal` dropped `return_url`, so every click failed with
  `return_url is required.`

### Notes for upgraders
- **Apps on the default starter or the packaged `somewhereAuth` handler see no
  change** — that handler already confirms cookie sessions.
- **A hand-written `/api/auth` handler that returns tokens must be updated**
  (or replaced with `somewhereAuth`) before upgrading. Scripts, CLIs and native
  clients that want tokens pass `mode: 'header'`, which is unchanged.
- A user already holding a stored token pair from a pre-0.2.0 install stays
  signed in; it moves to cookies on their next sign-in through a cookie-mode
  handler.

## 0.8.0 — The realtime surface is removed

Supersedes 0.7.6.

**Breaking (removal).** `sw.realtime`, `sw.channel(name)`, `createClient(...)
.channel(name)`, the `RealtimeClient` / `RealtimeChannelClient` classes, the
`dispatchRealtimeFrame` helper and the `ChannelStatus`,
`RealtimeBroadcastPayload`, `RealtimeBroadcastResponse` and
`RealtimeMetaResponse` types are gone. There is no alias and no deprecation
shim: the platform retired the caller-named channel API on 2026-09-18, the
`/v1/realtime/*` routes no longer exist (a developer key gets
`403 ROUTE_FORBIDDEN`), and an SDK method that can only fail is worse than no
method. Pre-1.0, the clean contract wins.

### Removed
- `src/resources/realtime.ts` and `src/resources/realtime-reconnect.ts`, with
  their tests and the `Client.realtimeToken` / `Client.wsBaseUrl` accessors
  that existed only to open the channel WebSocket.
- The README's broadcast-channel section and `channel(name)` from the list of
  namespaces the explicit client retains. The README's browser live-view
  guidance stays.
- 0.7.6's reframing of this surface, which had just relabelled the channel API
  as developer-authorized and documented a `403 CHANNEL_FORBIDDEN` refusal for
  app-user and visitor requests. That distinction is moot now that the routes
  themselves are gone: every caller, developer key included, gets
  `403 ROUTE_FORBIDDEN`.

### Notes for upgraders
- **Server-side fan-out and browser subscribe have no SDK replacement in this
  release.** The platform's two signed system channels now live at
  `POST /v1/events/subscribe` and `POST /v1/events/subscribe-user` (MCP:
  `events_subscribe_project`, `events_subscribe_user`). If the SDK grows a
  first-class client for them, that is where it will point — it is deliberately
  not built here.
- **Postgres change streams are unaffected.** `sw.db.live` and `/__sw/live/*`
  are platform surfaces that keep working; this SDK was never their client.
- **The cache's invalidation seam is unaffected.** `sw.invalidate(table)` is
  still public — wire it to whatever change signal your app has. 0.7.5/0.7.6
  changed its internals (generation-fenced cache warming, session-transition
  clearing); the public seam is the same call.
- **0.7.5 and 0.7.6 have no entries below.** Both shipped from master — the db
  query-array adapter, the cache result-shape isolation, and the browser
  authority / live-view doc contracts — and the version moved to 0.7.6 in
  `package.json` without notes being written. Those notes are not this lane's
  to author; the changes are in `9a1a642..97a4ad8`.

## 0.7.4 — Sign-in sets the session cookie by default

### Fixed
- **Sign-in now sets the session cookie by default.** A successful sign-up or
  sign-in through `somewhereAuth` stages the httpOnly session cookies whenever
  the runtime supports them, so the documented browser flow —
  `fetch('/api/auth/login', { credentials: 'include' })`, then
  `fetch('/api/auth/me', { credentials: 'include' })` — signs the user in and
  keeps them signed in, with no token handled in browser code. Previously the
  cookie was set only when the request carried the `X-Sw-Auth-Mode: cookie`
  header, which this SDK's own auth client sends but a plain `fetch` does not:
  sign-up returned 200 with no cookie at all, `/api/auth/me` then answered
  `{ "user": null }`, and every protected route stayed unauthorized.

### Notes for upgraders
- **Nothing you already have changes.** `X-Sw-Auth-Mode` now selects the
  response *body* only. Apps using this SDK's auth client are byte-identical.
  Any other caller — a raw `fetch`, a mobile or server client, a pre-0.2.0
  client — receives the exact response body it received before, now alongside
  a session cookie it is free to ignore.
- **Send `X-Sw-Auth-Mode: token` to opt out** if your backend mints its own
  session cookie from the returned tokens and does not want the platform pair
  set alongside it. Your own cookies are never touched either way: this handler
  only ever adds the platform session pair, and never reads or clears a cookie
  under any other name.

## 0.5.0 — Default-on query cache ("platform intelligence")

**Breaking (default behaviour change): `from().select()` is now cached by
default.** Apps get faster with zero code changes; the trade-off is that two
reads within ~1s can return the same bytes. Read-your-own-writes stays correct
(writes self-invalidate). Opt out per-query with `.fresh()` or globally with
`createClient(url, key, { cache: false })`.

### Added
- **Request dedup / single-flight** (always on when caching is enabled): two
  awaits of the same query while the first is in flight share ONE network
  request.
- **Short staleTime cache** (default **1000 ms**, client-instance scoped, so
  auth-scoped for free): a repeat read within the window is served from cache
  instead of refetching. Cache key = project + table + columns + filters +
  order + limit/offset + resolveType.
- **Invalidate-on-write**: a successful `insert`/`upsert`/`update`/`delete`
  drops that table's cached reads, so the next read is fresh.
- **`.fresh()`** modifier on a select — per-query opt-out (always hits the
  network; still warms the cache for the next normal read).
- **`createClient(url, key, { cache })`** — `false` to disable, or
  `{ staleTime }` to tune. Also on `new Somewhere({ cache })`.
- **`client.prefetch(query)`** — warm the cache ahead of need (hover-prefetch,
  route preload).
- **`client.invalidate(table)`** — manual cache drop; also the public seam for
  realtime-driven invalidation (a future realtime event for a table can call
  this — not built in 0.5.0, designed for).
- Exported `QueryCache` and the `CacheOptions` / `CacheConfig` types.

### Notes for upgraders
- Caching only affects the Supabase-style builder `from().select()`. Raw
  `sw.db.query(sql, params)` is **never** cached.
- If you depend on every `.select()` hitting the network (e.g. you poll
  sub-second and need each result fresh), set `{ cache: false }` or use
  `.fresh()`.
- The cache is per `createClient` instance and in-memory only — no cross-tab or
  persistent storage, and it resets when you create a new client (e.g. after a
  sign-in that swaps identity).
