/**
 * Typed compile-check ("typed source of truth") for the public SDK surface,
 * focused on the v0.5.0 DEFAULT-ON query cache (tsk_bbcbbad3 — productize
 * prong A). This file is TYPECHECKED by `npm test` (tsc -p tsconfig.test.json),
 * not executed — its job is to prove the documented cache API type-checks
 * exactly as the README shows it. Runtime behaviour is covered by
 * test/unit-cache.mjs; the live end-to-end smoke lives in test/run-basic.mjs.
 *
 * (Before v0.5.0 this file mirrored a `projects`/`deploy` SDK surface that the
 * Supabase migration removed — it had been left stale and was failing the
 * typecheck gate. Rewritten here against the current surface.)
